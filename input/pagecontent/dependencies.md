The following standards and profiles are referenced in this implementation guide:
- [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html): HL7 FHIR (Health Level 7 International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a modern standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It aims to make it easier for different health IT systems to work together by using web technologies and a modular approach
- [OASIS CAP](https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap-etl/v1.2/cn01/cap-etl-v1.2-cn01.html): CAP (Common Alerting Protocol) is a standardized data interchange protocol. CAP is open-source, XML-based, with clearly defined elements, and the ability to support data exchange across multiple dissemination channels, allowing a single input at the central hub to generate multiple outputs for downstream alerting. Furthermore, CAP provides a standardized template for submitting observations to the central hub (upstream), enhancing situational awareness and improving critical incident management.<br>A CAP-enabled system will more easily integrate with other national and international information systems. 
- [Mobile Care Services Discovery (mCSD)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD/): The mCSD profile supports the discovery of various care services resources, including organizations, facilities, locations, practitioners, and their roles
- [Mobile Alert Communication Management (mACM)](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_mACM.pdf): The mACM Profile provides the infrastructural components needed to send short, unstructured text alerts to human recipients and can record the outcomes of any human interactions upon receipt of the alert. The mACM Profile additionally allows for a feedback mechanism to determine the status of an alert through the use of alert statuses.
