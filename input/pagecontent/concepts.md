Concepts relevant for a HHAS solution:

**Healthcare Organization** - Organizations are "umbrella" entities; these may be considered the administrative bodies under whose auspices care services are provided such as Healthcare Information Exchanges (HIEs), Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) or even a one-physician family practice. An organization has a unique identifier and may have additional administrative attributes such as contact person, mailing address, etc. Departments of an institution, or other administrative units, may be represented as child Organizations of a parent Organization[^1].

**Healthcare Facility** - Facilities are physical care delivery sites such as hospitals, clinics, health outposts, physician offices, labs, pharmacies, etc. A Facility has a unique identifier, geographic attributes (address, geocode), contact attributes, attributes regarding its hours of operation, etc. Each Facility is defined by a pairing of Location and Organization[^1].

**Health Worker Registry** - Enterprise IDs for health workers within relevant healthcare networks[^2].

**CAP** - The CAP is a simple but general format for exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings over all kinds of networks.  CAP allows a consistent warning message to be disseminated simultaneously over many different warning systems, thus increasing warning effectiveness while simplifying the warning task.
