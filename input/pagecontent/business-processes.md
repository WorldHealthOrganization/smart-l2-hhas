A business process, or process, is a set of related activities or tasks 
performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, 
such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual 
representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) 
that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” 
for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication 
and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers. The workflows included in this IG depict processes that have been generalized across different contexts and may not reflect the variability and nuances across different settings. The simplicity of the workflow may not adequately illustrate the nonlinear steps that may occur.
