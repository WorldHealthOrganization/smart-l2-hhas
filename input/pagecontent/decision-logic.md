This page describes the decision-support logic included in the WHO
Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) for <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark>.

The decision-support logic component provides the decision logic and
algorithms in accordance with the recommendations within the <mark>[insert health domain here]</mark> guidelines and guidance and deconstruct them into a machine readable format that clearly labels the
inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital
decision-support system. The structure of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision Model and Notation (DMNâ„¢), an industry standard for modelling and executing decision logic.<br>
The table below presents the versions of the decision-support logic.
