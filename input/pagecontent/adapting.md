### Adapting for country use

The following page provides a reference to resources that can guide countries in adapting the specifications in this IG for country use.

The specifications included in this implementation guide provides the generic, software agnostic and software neutral content requirements. They are documentation of generic system requirements that need to be adapted to local needs; and subsequently used to inform the design of digital systems implemented locally.

WHO guidelines articulate and endorse rigorously tested recommendations for health interventions to be adopted within country programs. When applied correctly and consistently, guideline recommendations save lives. To ensure that countries can effectively benefit from digital health investments, the SMART Guidelines approach is intended to facilitate the adoption of WHO’s clinical, public health and data use guidelines in an accurate way in the digital systems that countries are adopting.
For more on layers of knowledge representation and how they are used in WHO’s SMART Guidelines approach, see [WHO’s SMART Guidelines](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines) and this [Lancet article](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00038-8/fulltext).

### Implementation considerations for a HHAS solution

#### Strategy and Investment
- Member States are increasingly looking to adopt digital solutions as part of the implementation or iteration of a HHAP;
- Member States will further adapt and extend these specifications to suit their needs, most likely working with a local technology partner of their choice to implement a digital solution;
- Member States have the capacity to maintain, update, and support the HHAS system, including technical expertise and resources.

#### Infrastructure
- Member States must have access to reliable and accessible communication infrastructure, including internet connectivity and mobile networks;
- Member States possess or are in the process of developing functional health information systems that can store and manage relevant data.

#### Legislation, Policy and Compliance
- Member States must adhere to their national legal and policy frameworks when implementing a HHAS solution.

#### Leadership and Governance
- Member States are typically tasked with implementing or overseeing their country’s HHAP;
- Member States are tasked with coordinating or at least facilitating the HHAP operational plans for health care and social services within the health system;
- A centralized infrastructure provides Member State’s the ability to assert and enforce governance policies on the utilization of alerting services. 

#### Workforce
- Member States will ensure that various agencies and personnel are trained in the use of the HHAS system and heat-related health protocols.

#### Services and Applications
- The HHAS solution operates at the national level, where centralized infrastructure exists to generate and disseminate alerts across national and sub-national systems.

#### Standards and Interoperability
